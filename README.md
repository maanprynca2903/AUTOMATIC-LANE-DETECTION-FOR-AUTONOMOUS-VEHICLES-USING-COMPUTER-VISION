One of the core tasks in autonomous driving and computer vision is lane line detection. It entails locating and defining lane markings on a road that are recorded in pictures or videos. Applications such as driverless vehicles, lane departure warning systems, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) depend heavily on this technology.

The main goal of lane line(Straight and Curved) detection is to give precise information about lane boundaries so that cars can drive safely along their intended routes. In this project, we worked on creating our own Python-based lane detecting system using OpenCV. We used the below mentioned Computer Vision concepts to effectively build and test out model for accurate lane line detection for both straight and curved lane lines :
1. Color Filtering in HSL
2. Region of Interest
3. Canny Edge Detection
4. Hough Transformation
5. Line Filtering & Averaging
6. Curve Fitting
